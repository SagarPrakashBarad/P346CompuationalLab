**What:** Bioinformatics analyzes biological data, primarily sequences like DNA, RNA, and proteins.

**Where from:** Data sources include biological repositories, publications, experiments, direct sequencing, public databases, and even computational predictions.

**Shifting Focus:** Traditional observation, theory, and hypothesis-driven approaches are now complemented by large-scale data accumulation and analysis.


## Big Rules of Biology

 While the DNA-RNA-Protein flow is vital, other "big rules" guide biology, like evolution, cell theory, and homeostasis.

\[ \text{DNA} \rightarrow \text{RNA} \rightarrow \text{Proteins} \]

    Functional domains within proteins exhibit higher conservation than non-functional domains.

### Sequence Alignment Task
Sequence alignment reveals similarities and highlights important functional regions.

Given sequences \(S_1\) and \(S_2\):

\[S_1 = \text{AACTACTCCTAACACT}\]
\[S_2 = \text{CTCCTACCTTACTTT}\]

#### Alignment

$$S_1 = AACTACT \ \ \ CCTAACACT \\ S_2 = \ \ \ CTCCTACCTTACTTT$$


#### Metrics

- \#matches = 10
- \#mismatches = 6
- \#spaces = 3


### Miscs

*Homologs* are genes, proteins, or structures in different species that share a common evolutionary origin. There are two main types:

#### Orthologs:
- Genes in different species that originated from a common ancestral gene.
- Divergence occurred through speciation.
- Typically retain similar functions in different species.

#### Paralogs:
- Genes within the same species that originated from a gene duplication event.
- Exist as multiple copies within the same genome.
- Divergence occurred within the species, and functions may differ due to adaptations.
